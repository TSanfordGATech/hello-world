# hello-world
I am learning to Code! 

I like kayaking, hiking, and spending time with my dogs. Coding, and working remotely, aligns with my future life goals. 

I also enjoy cooking- at times. My husband and I have started to explore different foods from different cultures. We are attempting to make these food items at home.
